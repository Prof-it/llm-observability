**Q: Is the current observability setup meeting the organization’s needs?**  
A: I think it’s getting better. There’s a foundation, and people are aware of the gaps. But it’s still tough for teams to answer bigger-picture questions or see patterns without a lot of manual work.

**Q: Has scaling the business had an impact?**  
A: Absolutely. It has just become much harder. There are more moving parts, and the challenge is tying things together to get a complete view. New services get built fast, and integrations don’t always keep up.

**Q: Is artificial intelligence starting to play a role?**  
A: I think this is feasible and it has just become much easier because of all these newer multi-cloud platforms. Our org is exploring some commercial AI options, and there’s experimentation going on. The missing piece is connecting all the business, telemetry, and operational data.

**Q: What are the technical barriers or enablers?**  
A: Technically, I’d say there’s just a lot out there already. The blocker is more about setting the standards and enabling everyone to work with the systems. We need the skills and some guardrails so people don't get overwhelmed.

**Q: Any suggestions to ensure successful adoption?**  
A: I’d recommend phased rollouts. Pilot first, get feedback, then scale up. Also document everything thoroughly—otherwise even the best system won’t get used.
