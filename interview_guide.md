1. How relevant is observability data to current operations?
   - How well does it inform engineering/product development?
   - How well does it inform business strategy?
2. Please rate (1–5, with reasons) your experience with the existing observability tool stack in terms of ease of use and access to insights.
3. Please rate (1–5, with reasons) how well the current stack supports debugging and incident response.
   - How much context do observability tools provide?
   - Is additional tacit knowledge from experts often needed?
   - How easily can you access system design/behavior knowledge?
4. Please rate (1–5, with reasons) how well you can link observability insights to business implications (e.g., impact on revenue/customer tickets).
5. Does the engineering culture favor transparency and shared perspectives? Do teams have context outside core areas?
6. How critical do you consider big data for fintechs? How well does the case fintech utilize big data currently?
7. Do you see value in holistic observability integrating telemetry with business/operational data?
8. This research positions LLMs as a tool for holistic observability—what are your thoughts?

- What factors will facilitate effective adoption from a data perspective?

**Engineering**
- How would you describe your experience with AI technologies?
- Thoughts or recommendations on the intended LPO system design?
- Is there existing AI/LLM infrastructure or strategy? Can it support LPO?
- Should the company adopt commercial solutions or develop in-house?
- Any recommendations for LPO accuracy/reliability (e.g., prompt engineering/fine-tuning)?
- Does the company have required engineering skills?
- What factors will facilitate adoption from an engineering perspective?
- Suggested metrics/indicators for LPO project success and ROI?
