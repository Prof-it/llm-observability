**Q: How well does the current observability tooling work for you and your team?**  
A: It covers the basics, but things can get complicated quickly. For more involved issues, especially ones that cut across multiple systems, the context is often missing, and we end up relying on people who have been around longer.

**Q: Can observability insights be linked to business or customer outcomes?**  
A: Only with effort. Sometimes you see a metric move but have no idea why, until someone connects it back to a release or an operational event. It would be great if we could tie things together better and surface the impact faster.

**Q: What are your thoughts on using AI or LLM approaches for observability?**  
A: I’m interested—there’s a lot of talk about using natural language to query data, which would help onboarding and also save us from writing scripts for every question. The main thing is accuracy and making sure people trust the outputs.

**Q: Are there organizational or technical obstacles to advancing observability?**  
A: Mainly skills and time. We don’t have enough people who are comfortable working with the data or configuring new tools, so anything new has to be really straightforward or come with good support.

**Q: Any priorities or advice if the company adopts LLM-powered solutions?**  
A: Focus on real use cases, not just cool features. No one will use a system if it slows them down or is hard to trust. And keep compliance and data privacy top of mind—those matter a lot in fintech.
