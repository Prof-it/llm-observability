**Q: How do you see the current state of observability in the organization?**  
A: We've made strides—it’s a lot better than where it was, but there’s still work to be done. The challenge now is moving from just collecting data to making sense of it across services. Integration is a pain point, especially when one issue cascades to another part of the system.

**Q: Are business implications of technical incidents visible?**  
A: Not easily. To connect a technical issue—say, API timeouts—to business impacts, you need to understand the whole flow, and that's not always possible from our dashboards. Sometimes the effect is immediate; other times, the impact is only understood much later.

**Q: Does the organization use AI in observability?**  
A: Not really. There’s a desire to, and the potential is there, but we aren't there yet. AI could help surface patterns or raise the right alerts before things escalate, but adoption depends on resources.

**Q: What factors affect the adoption of new observability tools?**  
A: There will be things that need to change—the company has to be able to make the investments, and teams need to prioritize the effort to get data cleaned up. Without executive buy-in and clear ownership, it’ll be hard to get things moving.

**Q: What about organizational readiness or skills?**  
A: There’s some AI awareness, but not enough depth. Capacity is stretched, and teams are already juggling lots. Upskilling and perhaps hiring will be needed if we want to do this well.

**Q: Advice for implementing LLM or AI-driven observability?**  
A: Set clear expectations up front and plan for gradual adoption. Roll out early wins, and most importantly, don’t forget governance and compliance—those are critical, especially in fintech.
